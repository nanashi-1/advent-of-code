This repository contains all my take on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Structure

The code for each solution is in its own folder (e.g. code for day 1 is in `"Day 1/"`). The main script is `index.ts`.

## How to run

Execute `./run <day>` where `<day>` is the day of the problem. For example. run `./run 1` to execute the solution for the first day.

## Solutions

-   [Day 1: Calorie Counting](/Day%201/README.md)

-   [Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors](Day%202/README.md)
